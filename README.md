# Hangman
From paper and pencil, to a mobile application. Hangman is a classic guessing game where the computer generates a word from LinkedIn's Word Dictionary API. The word is concealed, and the user has 6 guesses to guess the correct letters in each word. If the user guesses the correct letters in the secret word, the user wins. If the user does not guess the correct letter in 6 guesses or less, the user loses. Are you ready for the challenge?
